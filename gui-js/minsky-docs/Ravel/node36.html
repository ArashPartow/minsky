Slicing, Dicing and Rotating Data</A>
</H1>

<P>
A Ravel is a graphical representation of multi-dimensional data. Unlike
a spreadsheet, which has only two dimensions, a Ravel can have as
many dimensions as your data. You manipulate the axes of a Ravel to
select the components of your data that you wish to see, and those
components are then the output of the Ravel, which can be graphed
or displayed directly, or attached to variables which can be further
analysed using the flowchart equation capabilities of <I>Ravel</I>.
The Ravel below loads data from the <A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="https://data.bis.org/bulkdownload"><I>Bank of International Settlements</I></A>
on house prices. This data has four dimensions:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Date</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Quarterly data from 1927 till 2024: 388 entries 
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Unit of Measure</STRONG></DT>
<DD>House Price Index where 2010 = 100; 2 entries 
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Value</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Nominal or Real (CPI-deflated) prices: 2 entries 
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Reference Area</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Country or Region: 62 entries 
</DD>
</DL>

<P>

<P>
When a Ravel is first attached to data, it outputs the entire data
set--which is indicated by the dimension count <I>4D</I> in the
lower right quadrant of this Ravel. You can see this by attaching
a Sheet to the output port of the Ravel:

<P>
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="img70.png"
 ALT="\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/tut01Ravel4DwithSheet}% WIDTH=556 HEIGHT=159 ">

<P>
The right-pointing axis of the Ravel determines what is shown on the
rows of the sheet, while the down-pointing Axes of the Ravel determine
what is shown by the columns. At present these are Reference Area
by Value, and the sheet shows a slice of that data for the first entry
in the Date and Value axes-1927-Q3, and Nominal (unadjusted for
inflation).

<P>
It would be more useful to see the data by Reference Area by Date.
To get that view, click the left mouse button on the arrowhead of
the Date axis, hold the button down, and rotate the axis into the
down direction, which is currently occupied by the Value axis. When
you release the mouse button, the Date axis will replace the Unit
of measure axis in the down direction, and the data in the Sheet will
now have countries by rows and Quarters by columns.

<P>
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="img71.png"
 ALT="\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/tut02HPI4DwithSheetRotatedCountryDate}% WIDTH=556 HEIGHT=159 ">

<P>
The Sheet is still blank, because there is no data for the current
selections-there is no data for Index for Nominal House Prices in
the very first Quarters of the data (in the years 1927 and 1928) for
the first countries in the file in alphabetical order.

<P>
To see data immediately, you can take advantage of a feature of the
Sheet: it can display the first few rows and columns of data (the
default setting), which we call the Head, the last few (the Tail),
or a few of both (Head and Tail). To show the last few rows and columns,
right-click on the Sheet and choose Row Slices/Tail and Column Slices/Tail".
That will then show you the last countries in the data file in alphabetical
order, and the last quarters in the data file.

<P>
The data still shows the Nominal Index data, since these are the first
entries in the other two axes. You can control the entry shown using
the selector dots on those two axes: these are the coloured dots that
are currently within the inner circle of the Ravel. Selector dots
can be moved:

<UL>
<LI>By using the mouse. Click on a dot and drag it to the required selection;
or 
</LI>
<LI>By using the arrow keys. Use the mouse to move the cursor so that
it is hovering over an axis; then use the up or right arrow key to
move the dot out towards the arrowhead on an axis, or the down or
left arrow key to move back towards the center. 
</LI>
</UL>
To see the Real (CPI-adjusted) annual rate of change of house prices,
use the selector dot on those two axes. That selection is shown below-where
Date has also been rotated to the rows so that Countries are shown
by the columns. This already gives one interesting insight: house
prices were on average falling across advanced countries in 2023.

<P>
To really develop insights from your data, you attach the output of
the Ravel to variables, and analyse them using <I>Ravel</I>'s flowchart
mathematics formulas.
