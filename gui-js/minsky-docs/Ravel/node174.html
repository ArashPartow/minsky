Introduction to the Ravel GUI Object</A>

A Ravel is inserted onto the wiring canvas by clicking on the 
  <IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="img44.png"
 ALT="\resizebox{!}{2ex}{\includegraphics{images/RavelIcon}}% WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=14 ">
  widget
from the toolbar. The first Ravel inserted into a document appears
in Edit mode as shown below, with indicative Axis names:

<P>
The essential step in using a Ravel is to attach data to it via the
triangular input port. See <A HREF="node187.html#CSV_import">importing CSV files</A>
for how to import data.  When a data file is attached to the input
port of a Ravel, a multi-arrowed object fills the Ravel rectangle. If
there are seven dimensions or more to the data, it will appear as
shown below, with arrows in a pastel shade and axes labels not shown
unless your mouse is hovering over an axis:

<P>

 ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="img259.png"
 ALT="\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{images/RavelDataImporting01}% WIDTH=389 HEIGHT=268 ">

<P>
With six or fewer dimensions it will appear as shown below, with full-colour
axes and axis labels shown:

<P>

  <IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="img260.png"
 ALT="\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{images/RavelDataImporting02}% WIDTH=389 HEIGHT=431 ">

<P>
The arrows are the dimensions of the data; the dots are selectors
for specific values on each dimension. When a <A HREF="node187.html#CSV_import">CSV import parameter</A> is first attached to a Ravel, all the selector
dots are in the centre of the Ravel, so that all the data in the Ravel
is output to any Variable, Sheet or Plot attached to it. The next
figure shows all 4 selectors being used so that the Ravel outputs
the annualized rate of inflation for the USA in June 2022.

<P>

 ALT="\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/RavelSingleDataPointSelected}% WIDTH=556 HEIGHT=419 ">

<P>
If the selector dot remains in the centre for one dimension, then
a column of data for that dimension is output from the Ravel:

<P>

 ALT="\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/RavelDataSeriesSelected}% WIDTH=555 HEIGHT=274 ">

<P>
With two selector dots remaining in the centre, an array of data is
output. This results in multiple countries' inflation rates being
plotted:

<P>
Clearly a number of countries had extreme rates of inflation at various
times between the 1970s and the mid-1990s. There are Ravel functions
which can be used to isolate these countries (see <A HREF="node50.html#Operations"><I>Operations</I></A>),
but it is also easy to identify them visually by moving the selector
dot along the Reference Area axis. You can do this by either:

<UL>
<LI>Clicking on the selector dot with the mouse and dragging it along
the axis; or
</LI>
<LI>Hovering the mouse over the axis and using the arrow keys. The up-arrow
and right-arrow move you forward along a data axis from the first
entry to the last; the down and left arrow keys move you backward.
</LI>
</UL>
Eyeballing the data indicates that a 40% annual inflation rate is
the dividing line between countries which did and did not experience
a hyperinflation in the post-WWII period (defined as from 1955 onwards
to exclude WWII-influenced price disturbances--for instance, those
associated with the Russian occupation of Austria ending in 1955).
That set of countries (Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia,
Croatia, Czechia, Estonia, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania,
Mexico, North Macedonia, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Serbia,
Slovakia, Slovenia and Turkey) are identified in the next figure as
``HyperInflation'' countries, while the remainder are ``NormalInflation''
countries. Except for Iceland, Israel, the Philippines, and Turkey,
the hyperinflation countries were either South American, or countries
which underwent the transition from socialism to capitalism in the
1990s. This figure also shows the iconized version of a Ravel, which
is generated by toggling ``Editor mode'' on the context menu (also,
by default, the first Ravel inserted into a document is in Editor
mode, and all subsequent Ravels are inserted in iconized mode).

<P>
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="img264.png"
 ALT="\includegraphics[width=15cm]{images/RavelDataLockedSubsets}% WIDTH=680 HEIGHT=709 ">

<P>
This selection employed one context-menu feature of a Ravel--``Pick
Axis Slices'' was used on the Reference area axis to choose countries
which had annual inflation rate of above 40% between 1955 and 2024--and
one Ravel-specific widget, the <A HREF="node184.html#Lock">Lock</A>, which creates a
subset of the data which can be allocated to a variable. The selection
on the Ravel can then be changed without altering the subset selected
by the Lock.

<P>
Now that the data is sensibly divided, it is feasible to calculate
average inflation rates for normal countries. This is done by choosing
``Av'' on the context menu command ``Set next aggregation'', and
then dragging the Reference Area axis in to the centre of the Ravel.

<P>
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="img265.png"
 ALT="\includegraphics[width=15cm]{images/CPI_SubsetsAverages}% WIDTH=679 HEIGHT=547 ">

<P>
It is now possible to compare the inflation of individual countries
to the average for all normal inflation countries. In the next figure,
the USA and Japan were selected using Pick axis slices, and their
data is graphed against the average. This shows that Japan's inflation
rate exceeded America's--and the average--until 1975, after which
Japan's inflation rate has been consistently lower than that of the
USA and the average.
