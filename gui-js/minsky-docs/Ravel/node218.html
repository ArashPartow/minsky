Block diagram example</A>
</H2>

<P>
One of the very first models of a dynamic system was developed independently
by the mathematicians <A NAME="tex2html39"
  HREF="https://www.jstor.org/stable/84156">Lokta</A>
and <A NAME="tex2html40"
  HREF="https://www.nature.com/articles/118558a0">Volterra</A>
and is now known as the <A NAME="tex2html41"
  HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations">Lotka-Volterra model</A>.
This model simulates interacting populations of predators and prey,
which had been seen to display fluctuations that either could not
be explained by exogenous shocks, or which displayed counterintuitive
responses to exogenous shocks--such as the observed increase in
the proportion of predators (sharks, rays, etc.) in the fishing catch
in the Adriatic Sea during WWI, when biologists had expected the <A NAME="tex2html42"
  HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations#History">proportion
of predators to fall</A>.

<P>
The basic dynamics of the predator-prey model are that the number
of prey is assumed to grow exponentially in the absence of predators,
while the number of predators is assumed to fall exponentially in
the absence of prey. Using Rabbits as our example of prey and Foxes
as our example of predators, the initial dynamic equations are :

<P>
<IMG
 SRC="img305.png"
 ALT="\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{d}{dt}Rabbits=r\times Rabbits\\
\frac{d}{dt}Foxes=-f\times Foxes
\end{array}\end{displaymath}% WIDTH=363 HEIGHT=46 ">

<P>
When interaction between predators and prey is considered, the simplest
assumption is that predators reduce the growth rate of prey (<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="img234.png"
 ALT="$r$% WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=14 ">) by
some constant <IMG
 ALIGN="MIDDLE" SRC="img306.png"
 ALT="$\left(\rho\right)$% WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=31 "> times how many predators there
are, while prey reduce the death rate of predators (<IMG
 ALIGN="MIDDLE" SRC="img226.png"
 ALT="$f$% WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=30 ">) by another
constant <IMG
 ALIGN="MIDDLE" SRC="img307.png"
 ALT="$\left(\phi\right)$% WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=31 "> times how many prey there are:

<P>
<IMG
 SRC="img308.png"
 ALT="\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{d}{dt}Rabbits=\left(r-\rho\times Foxe...
...oxes=\left(-f+\phi\times Rabbits\right)\times Foxes
\end{array}\end{displaymath}% WIDTH=418 HEIGHT=46 ">

<P>
The non-zero equilibrium of this system is easily calculated by setting
the differential equations to zero:

<P>
<IMG
 SRC="img309.png"
 ALT="\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{c}
Rabbit_{Eq}=\frac{f}{\phi}\\
Fox_{Eq}=\frac{r}{\rho}
\end{array}\end{displaymath}% WIDTH=325 HEIGHT=50 ">

<P>
Mathematicians initially expected that this model would converge to
this equilibrium over time, but this was not the case:
quotePeriodic phenomena play an important role in nature, both organic
and inorganic ...it appeared, from the nature of the solution
obtained, improbable that undamped, permanent oscillations would arise
... It was, therefore, with considerable surprise that the writer,
on applying his method to certain special cases, found these to lead
to <A NAME="tex2html38"
  HREF="https://www.jstor.org/stable/84156">undamped, and hence indefinitely continued, oscillations</A>.

<P>
The mathematical reason for this phenomenon is fairly easily derived
by mathematical stability analysis. For a system as simple as this,
the main advantage of a system dynamics program is that it enables
the numerical simulation of this model. To do this, this system <I>of
ordinary differential equations</I> needs to be converted into <I>integral
equations,</I> since numerical integration is a more accurate process
than numerical differentiation. In mathematical form, these integral
equations are:

<IMG
 SRC="img310.png"
 ALT="\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{c}
Rabbits=Rabbits_{0}+\int\left(\left(r-\rho\...
...eft(-f+\phi\times Rabbits\right)\times Foxes\right)
\end{array}\end{displaymath}% WIDTH=459 HEIGHT=45 ">

<P>
Here <IMG
 ALIGN="MIDDLE" SRC="img311.png"
 ALT="$Rabbits_{0}$% WIDTH=64 HEIGHT=30 ">and <IMG
 ALIGN="MIDDLE" SRC="img312.png"
 ALT="$Foxes_{0}$% WIDTH=55 HEIGHT=30 "> represent the initial number of
Rabbits and Foxes.

<P>
The next figure shows this model in <I>Minsky</I>, with the initial
conditions set up so that they differ slightly from the equilibrium.
To see how to build a model like this step by step, see <A HREF="node222.html#Minsky_model_building">Minsky model building</A>:

<P>
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="img313.png"
 ALT="\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/PredatorPreyRabbitsFoxes}% WIDTH=555 HEIGHT=290 ">

<P>
Programs like Vensim and Simulink have been in existence for decades,
and they are now mature products that provide everything their user-base
of management consultants and engineers want for modeling and analyzing
complex dynamic systems. So why has <I>Minsky</I> been developed?
The key reason is its unique feature of <A HREF="node220.html#Godley-Tables">Godley Tables</A>,
which allow dynamic equations to be developed for monetary transactions
via double-entry bookkeeping tables.
