<H1><A NAME="SECTION00100000000000000000">
Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
<A NAME="Introduction"></A><I>Ravel</I> is a data analysis program which
is an alternative to spreadsheets and existing business intelligence
programs (Tableau, Power BI, etc.). It has two key features that distinguish
it from all other programs in this space: 

<UL>
<LI>The Ravel, a visual representation of multidimensional data that is
far easier to use than Pivot Tables; and
</LI>
<LI>Equations that are written as flowcharts, rather than the obscure
cell references of spreadsheets.
</LI>
</UL>
It also includes the system-dynamics engine <A HREF="node214.html#Introduction-Minsky"><I>Minsky</I></A>.

<P>
Unlike spreadsheets, which are fundamentally limited to two dimensions
(rows and columns), <I>Ravel</I> supports an effectively unlimited
number of dimensions. <I>Ravel</I>'s key feature--also called a
Ravel--is a visual tool for manipulating and analysing multidimensional
data, which can handle as many dimensions as your data contains. By
contrast, to handle more than 2 dimensions in a spreadsheet, the go to
tool is a <EM>Pivot table</EM>, which provides some sort of control over
the slice through the multidimensional <EM>hypercube</EM>. Needless the
say, pivot tables are not for the faint of heart!

<P>
Ravel is primarily focussed on numerical data, although it is possible
to analyse purely symbolic data in <A HREF="node191.html#counter">``counter mode''</A>.

<P>
This is a blank Ravel--a Ravel with no data attached to it. The
axes are indicative examples, and will be replaced by the dimensions
of your data, once you attach a data parameter to the Ravel:

<P>

 ALT="\includegraphics{images/RavelBlank}% WIDTH=410 HEIGHT=401 ">

<P>
To use a Ravel, you first need to import a data file-at present
this must be a CSV file (other data sources will be added in later
releases). Once the data is <A HREF="node187.html#CSV_import">imported</A>, the data object
can be attached to a Ravel. This is a Ravel with data attached:

<P>

<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="img31.png"
 ALT="\includegraphics{images/01RavelDataInflation}% WIDTH=394 HEIGHT=436 ">

<P>
There are many ways to manipulate and display data directly from a
Ravel. This is a Ravel with data attached and selected for graphing:
the ``Year on Year Changes'' data is selected from the Unit of Measure
axis; two countries (Japan and the United States) are selected from
the Reference area axis via the <I>Pick axis slices</I> command; Monthly
data is chosen from the Frequency axis; and Calipers are applied to
the Date axis to select data from 1960 till 2024.

<P>

<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="img32.png"
 ALT="\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/01BRavelDataInflationSelected}% WIDTH=556 HEIGHT=295 ">

<P>
Ravel the object itself makes it far easier to drill down into and
visualise data than using either a spreadsheet, or the Pivot Tables
that standard Business Intelligence program use.

<P>
<I>Ravel</I> the program enables easy analysis of data using self-documenting
flowchart formulas. This is a Ravel with data selected-for six countries,
on the annualised monthly inflation rate, for dates from January 2001
till January 2024-and assigned to a variable (``Post2000'').

<P>

  <IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="img33.png"
 ALT="\includegraphics{images/02RavelDataInflationGraphed}% WIDTH=641 HEIGHT=874 ">

<P>
The data is analyzed by (a) working out the average inflation rate
for the selected countries, and (b) subtracting the average from the
actual inflation rate for each country.

<P>
The average inflation rate is calculated using the formula shown below,
where the 
  <IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="img28.png"
 ALT="\resizebox{!}{2ex}{\includegraphics{images/mean}}% WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=14 ">
  operator works out the average
inflation rate over time for the six countries in the variable <I>Post2000</I>
to generate the variable <I>Inflation</I><SUB><I>Average</I></SUB>.
This average is then subtracted from the country-specific data in
<I>Post2000</I>:

<P>

  <IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="./03Formula.png"
 ALT="Image 03Formula% WIDTH=1281 HEIGHT=205 ">

<P>
This one formula is applied to every country in the Ravel (six countries
in this case) and every quarterly data point (80 quarters). Doing
the same analysis with a spreadsheet would require writing an obscure
cell reference formula and replicating it across 480 cells.

<P>
This example shows average inflation outcomes for the six countries,
and the deviation of each of them from the average.

<P>

  <IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="img34.png"
 ALT="\includegraphics{images/03RavelDataInflationAnalyzed}% WIDTH=1160 HEIGHT=1322 ">

<P>
This illustrates the capacity of Ravel to rapidly provide insights
from data-in this case, that the best-performing country during
the post-Covid inflation was Japan, and the worst performing were
the USA and UK. This is noteworthy, because both the USA and UK sharply
increased interest rates with the intention of reducing inflation,
while Japan kept its interest rate constant. Perhaps then, interest
rates aren't effective at controlling inflation rates? 

<P>
These examples are drawn from economics, mainly because <I>Ravel</I>'s
inventor is an economist (and a contrarian one at that). But <I>Ravel</I>
can analyze any data you give it--marketing data, scientific data,
production data, whatever. It can also handle enormous data sets,
far larger than are manageable with Excel.

<P>
Ravel can handle sparse data--it requires 16 bytes per data point, so
for example, a 16GB computer will technically be able to handle up to a billion
data points, although in practice it is unwise to exceed more than
half that. There is no limit to the number of rows and columns it can
ingest, subject to the overall limit due to available memory, in
contrast to Excel's limits of 1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns. One
other limit to keep in mind is that the size of the datacube (product
of sizes of all the dimensions) cannot exceed <IMG
 ALIGN="MIDDLE" SRC="img29.png"
 ALT="$1.8\times
10^{19}$% WIDTH=73 HEIGHT=33 ">. This is something to bear in mind when importing data, as
the datacube size increases exponentially with the number of
dimensions.

<P>
We hope these examples show how easy it is to turn data into information
using Ravel.
