%\subsection{Manipulating items on the canvas}
%
%\begin{description}
%\item[To move] and item, click on the interior of an item and drag it
%to the new position.
%\item[To wire items] click on the small circle representing the output
%port, and drag out a wire towards an input port on another item.
%\item[To lasso], click outside of any item and drag out a rectangular
%region.
%\item[To pan] the canvas, hold the shift key down whilst dragging on
%the canvas.
%\end{description}

%\begin{description}
%\item[Wire] This draws wires that connect one operator on the Canvas
%to another. For example, if you have placed these icons on the
%Palette: 
%
%\htmladdimg{NewItem24.png}
%
%and you now want to link them together into an equation, then click on
%the Wire button, move the cursor to the right end of GDP, and click
%and drag to the top of the divide symbol:
%
%\htmladdimg{NewItem25.png}
%
%Do the same for LabProd, and to attach the Divide icon to the left
%hand side of Workers, and you've defined the equation that the number
%of workers employed equals GDP divided by labor productivity. The
%flowchart will look like this: 
%
%\htmladdimg{NewItem26.png}
%
%And this is the equation you have now created:
%\begin{displaymath}
%\mathrm{Workers}=\frac{\mathrm{GDP}}{\mathrm{LabProd}}
%\end{displaymath}
%
%\item[Move] This is the default mode for the mouse, and it lets you:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Move already entered icons around the Canvas by clicking on
%them, holding the mouse button down, and releasing it when you have
%got to the desired location; 
%\item Select an item from the Design Icons and place it on the
%Canvas. When you first click on an Icon, it will either appear at the
%top left hand corner of the Canvas, or bring up a menu where you enter
%various essential details (Name, value etc.), after which the Icon
%appears at the top left hand corner of the Canvas. It will then snap
%to wherever the mouse cursor currently is, and can be placed on the
%Canvas by clicking.
%\end{itemize}
%\item[Pan] This moves all the Icons on the Canvas as a group, which is useful
%when you have a very large model and you want to move to a small part
%of it. Choose Pan, click and hold the mouse button down, and then move
%the mouse. The entire model will shift with the mouse.
%
%\item[Lasso] Lassoing is the first step in creating a Group, or
%selecting multiple Icons for some operation (copying, deleting,
%etc.---these are not yet implemented but will be in the next major
%release).
%\end{description}
%
%        Grouping. Choose Lasso, click and hold down the mouse button,
%        then drag over the region you wish to make into a group:
%
%\htmladdimg{NewItem117.png}
%
%
%Release the mouse button, and a box will be drawn around the selected
%items which can now be moved as a single entity. The inputs to the
%group are noted on the input side of the group, and the outputs on the
%output side:
%
%\htmladdimg{NewItem118.png}
%
%One unique feature of Minsky (when compared to existing system
%dynamics programs) is that the contents of the group can still be seen
%inside the group window, and they can also be edited from there. In
%the next image, the contents of the group were moved more cleanly
%inside the group (this feature is still being implemented, so some
%tidying up was needed, but was possible without having to open the
%group in a separate window):
