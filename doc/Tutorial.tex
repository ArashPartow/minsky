\section{Slicing, Dicing and Rotating Data}

A Ravel is a graphical representation of multi-dimensional data. Unlike a spreadsheet, which has only two dimensions, a Ravel can have as many dimensions as your data. You manipulate the axes of a Ravel to select the components of your data that you wish to see, and those components are then the output of the Ravel, which can be graphed or displayed directly, or attached to variables which can be further analysed using the flowchart equation capabilities of Ravel. The Ravel below loads data from the Bank of International Settlements on house prices. This data has four dimensions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[Date] Quarterly data from 1927 till 2024: 388 entries
\item[Unit of Measure] House Price Index where 2010 = 100; 2 entries
\item[Value] Nominal or Real (CPI-deflated) prices: 2 entries
\item[Reference Area] Country or Region: 62 entries
\end{enumerate}

When a Ravel is first attached to data, it outputs the entire data set---which is indicated by the dimension count \emph{4D} in the lower right quadrant of this Ravel. You can see this by attaching a Sheet to the output port of the Ravel:

\includegraphics{images/tut01Ravel4DwithSheet.eps}

The right-pointing axis of the Ravel determines what is shown on the rows of the sheet, while the down-pointing Axes of the Ravel determine what is shown by the columns. At present these are Reference Area by Value, and the sheet shows a slice of that data for the first entry in the Date and Value axes--1927-Q3 and Nominal.

It would be more useful to see the data by Reference Area by Date. To get that view, click the left mouse button on the arrowhead of the Date axis, hold the button down, and rotate the axis into the down direction, which is currently occupied by the Value axis. When you release the mouse button, the Date axis will replace the Unit of measure axis in the down direction, and the data in the Sheet will now have countries by rows and Quarters by columns.

\includegraphics{images/tut02HPI4DwithSheetRotatedCountryDate.eps}

The Sheet is still blank because there is no data for the current selections--the Index for Nominal House Prices in the very first Quarters of the data (in the years 1927 and 1928) for the first countries in the file in alphabetical order.

To see data immediately, you can take advantage of a feature of the Sheet: it can display the first few rows and columns of data (the default setting), which we call the Head, the last few (the Tail), or a few of both (Head and Tail). To show the last few rows and columns, right-click on the  Sheet and choose Row Slices/Tail and Column Slices/Tail". That will then show you the last countries in the data file in alphabetical order, and the last quarters in the data file.

The data still shows the Nominal Index data, since these are the first entries in the other two axes. You can control the entry shown using the selector dots on those two axes: these are the coloured dots that are currently within the inner circle of the Ravel. Selector dots can be moved:

\begin{itemize}
\item By using the mouse. Click on a dot and drag it to the required selection; or
\item By using the arrow keys. Use the mouse to move the cursor so that it is hovering over an axis; then use the up or right arrow key to move the dot out towards the arrowhead on an axis, or the down or left arrow key to move back towards the center.
\end{itemize}

To see the Real (CPI-adjusted) annual rate of change of house prices, use the selector dot on those two axes. That selection is shown below--where Date has also been rotated to the rows so that Countries are shown by the columns. This already gives one interesting insight: house prices were falling across the world in 2023.

To really develop insights from your data, you attach the output of the Ravel to variables, and analyse them using Ravel's flowchart mathematics formulas.

\section{Attaching Variables to Ravels}

The source data file combines information on House Price Indices (where the base year is 2010, so all indices are 100 during 2010), and the annual rate of change of house prices, with data on both Nominal and Real (CPI-deflated) prices. To analyse the data, it is useful to separate it into House Price Index information and House Price Inflation information, and to focus on Real rather than Nominal Prices. That is done by attaching the output of the Ravel to Locks, and the Locks to named Variables that you create.

The next image shows two variables $HPI_{Real}$ and $\Delta{HPI}$. The lock for $\Delta{HPI}$ has been closed, while the lock for $HPI_{Real}$ is still open. Once the lock is closed, the output from that lock remains the same, even if the selection on the source Ravel is altered.

With the data separated into index and inflation data, we can now focus on those subsets of the data rather than the entire source file. The next image shows the source Ravel in icon mode, with the house price inflation data attached to another Ravel and the currently selected data displayed in a sheet.

The information in the sheet suggests a possibly useful piece of analysis: why not compare the average for all advanced countries (the first entry on the Reference Area axis) to each advanced country?

The image below shows the result of attempting to do this by selecting just the data for "Advanced Economies" (this is done using the "Pick Axis Slices" option on the right-click menu for the Reference Area axis, and then choosing several entries by using control-click) and attaching that to a new variable $\Delta{HPI}_{Advanced}^{Avg}$, while selecting a number of advanced economies from the axis (Australia, Austria, Belgium, etc.) and assigning that to another variable $\Delta{HPI}_{Advanced}$.
