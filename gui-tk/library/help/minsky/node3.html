Experienced in system dynamics?
</H1>

<P>
As an experienced system dynamics user (or if you've just read <A HREF="node2.html#intro:new">``New to
system dynamics?''</A>), what you need to know is what Minsky
provides that other system dynamics programs don't. That boils down to
one feature: The Godley Table that enables a dynamic model of
financial flows to be derived from a table that is very similar to the
accountant's double-entry bookkeeping table.

<P>
The dynamics in financial flows could be modeled using the block diagram
paradigm. But it would also be very, very easy to make a mistake
modeling financial flows in such a system, for one simple reason:
every financial flow needs to be entered at least twice in a
system--once as a source, and once as a sink.

<P>
For example, if you go shopping and buy a new computer with your
credit card, you increase your debt to a bank and simultaneously
increase the deposit account of the retailer from whom you buy the
computer. The two system states in this model-your credit card
(``BuyerCredit'') and the retailer's deposit account
(``SellerDeposit'')--therefore have to have the same entry (let's call
this ``Card'') made into them. In Vissim, such a transaction would look
like this:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="NewItem11.png"
 ALT="81">

</DIV>

<P>
That would work, but there's nothing in the program that warns you if
you make a mistake like, for example, wiring up the BuyerCredit entry,
but forgetting the SellerDeposit one:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="NewItem12.png"
 ALT="82">

</DIV>

<P>
Or, perhaps, wiring up both blocks, but giving one the wrong sign:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="NewItem51.png"
 ALT="83">

</DIV>

<P>
In a very complex model, you might make a mistake like one of the above, run the simulation and get nonsense results, and yet be unable to locate your mistake.

<P>
Minsky avoids this problem by using the paradigm that accountants
developed half a millennium ago to keep financial accounts accurately:
double-entry bookkeeping. Here is the same model in Minsky:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="NewItem13.png"
 ALT="84">

</DIV>

<P>
This is an inherently better way to generate a dynamic model of financial flows, for at least two reasons:

<UL>
<LI>All financial transactions are flows between entities. The
  tabular layout captures this in a very natural way: each row shows
  where a flow originates, and where it ends up
</LI>
<LI>The program adopts the accounting practice of double-entry
  bookkeeping, in which entries on each row sum to zero. The source is
  shown as a ``<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.png"
 ALT="$+$"></SPAN>'', the sink is shown as a ``<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.png"
 ALT="$-$"></SPAN>'', and assets are shown
  as a positive sum while liabilities are shown as a negative. If you
  don't ensure that each flow starts somewhere and ends
  somewhere--say you make the same mistake as in the block diagram
  examples above, then the program will identify your mistake.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
If you forget to enter the recipient in this transaction, then the Row
Sum identifies your mistake by showing that the row sums to ``Card''
rather than zero:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="NewItem52.png"
 ALT="85">

</DIV>

<P>
And it also identifies if you give the wrong sign to one entry:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="NewItem53.png"
 ALT="86">

</DIV>

<P>
Minsky thus adds an element to the system dynamics toolkit which is
fundamental for modeling the monetary flows that are an intrinsic
aspect of a market economy. Future releases will dramatically extend
this capability.
