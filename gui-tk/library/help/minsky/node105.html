Godley Tables
</H1>

<P>
Godley tables describes sets of financial flows from the point of view
of a particular economic agent, such as a bank. The columns of the
table represent accounts (possibly aggregated), which are treated as
integration variables by the system. Accounts may be assets,
liabilities or equities. Assets may appear as liabilities in another
agent's Godley table, and vice versa, with the sense of the financial
flows treated oppositely (a credit flow increasing the asset of one
entity will appear as a debit flow, increasing the value of a
liability). Transfers between accounts should satisfy the <EM>  accounting equation</EM><A ID="2555"></A>
(Assets-Liabilities-Equities = 0). So if the transfer is between an
asset and a liability, then it should appear with the same sign (both
positive or both negative), otherwise between two accounts of the same
type, or between a liability and an equity, the terms should have
opposite signs.

<P>
Instead of signed flows, one can optionally use CR and DR prefixes, as
specified in the options panel. Each row of the table should have have
one CR entry, and one DR entry. The row sum column should be zero if
it is done correctly.

<P>
The first row specifies the stock variables, after which follow the
flow rows. Usually, the row marked &ldquo;Initial Conditions&rdquo; comes next,
but may be placed in any position. These specify the initial
conditions of the stock variables, and may refer to a multiple of
another variable, just like the <A HREF="node95.html#var:init">initial condition
field</A>, or just be a numerical value.

<P>
Finally come the flows. The first column is a simple textual label
(the phrase &ldquo;Initial Conditions&rdquo;, regardless of capitalisation, is a
reserved phrase for setting stock variable initial conditions)
identifying the flow. The flows themselves are written as a numerical
multipler times a flow variable.
