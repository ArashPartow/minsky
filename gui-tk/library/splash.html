    <title>Change to Minsky distribution</title>

    This is the very last version of Minsky for which Windows and
    MacOSX builds will be available for free. Supporting the binary
    builds is not a negligible cost - not only is programming time
    required dealing with OS idiosyncracies, but also there is a real
    annual cost purchasing certificates for signing the code. We ask
    that you <a href="http://patreon.com/hpcoder">sign up for a
    donation for as little as US $1 per month</a> to help support
    this. Any additional donation you make will be appreciated to help
    the development of Minsky.

      An additional reason for this change is to help build the
      community via email contacts. You will have the option of
      signing up anonymously if you'd rather not be involved.

      We remain committed to open source, and Minsky will always be
      open source. You are most welcome to download the source code
      and build it yourself. The binary packages are a convenience
      service for those who'd rather spend their time doing something
      else.
