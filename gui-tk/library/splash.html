    <h1>Change to Minsky distribution</h1>

    This is the very last version of Minsky for which Windows and
    MacOSX builds will be available for free on SourceForge and
    Github.
<p>
    Future Windows and MacOSX builds will be available
    by <a href="http://patreon.com/hpcoder">signing up on Patreon</a>
    for as little as US $1 per
    month. <a href="http://minsky.sf.net/changelog.html">See what's changed since
    this release.</a>
<p>
    We remain committed to open source, and Minsky will always be
    open source. You are most welcome to download the source code
    and build it yourself. The binary packages are a convenience
    service for those who'd rather spend their time doing something
    else.
